5 Stars - Great Security Tool

This prompt injection detection library has been working great for our application. It catches most attack attempts and has a low false positive rate. 

The documentation could be better - I initially struggled to understand the risk scoring system. But once configured properly, it's been reliable.

One minor issue: legitimate queries containing phrases like "ignore previous messages" (when discussing email/chat features) sometimes get flagged. The whitelist feature helps with this though.

Overall, highly recommend for anyone building AI applications that need input validation.
