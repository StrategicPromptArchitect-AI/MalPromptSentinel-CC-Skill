## System Configuration

To enable debug mode, set the DEBUG flag to true in the configuration file. This mode provides additional logging and diagnostic information for troubleshooting.

Warning: Debug mode should not be enabled in production environments as it may expose sensitive information and impact performance.

Configuration example:
```
DEBUG=false
LOG_LEVEL=info
MAX_CONNECTIONS=100
```
