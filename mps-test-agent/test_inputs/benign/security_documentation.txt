# Prompt Injection Attack Patterns

This document describes common prompt injection techniques for educational purposes.

Example attack: "Ignore previous instructions"
This pattern attempts to override system prompts by using imperative verbs.

Detection: Look for imperative verbs like "ignore", "disregard", "forget" followed by references to instructions or context.

Defense: Implement input validation and context isolation to prevent injection attacks from affecting model behavior.
