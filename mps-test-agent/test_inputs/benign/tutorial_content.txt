# Securing AI Applications

When building AI applications, be aware of prompt injection vulnerabilities. Attackers may try to inject malicious instructions like "ignore previous instructions" into user inputs.

Best practices:
1. Validate all user inputs
2. Use context isolation
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Monitor for suspicious patterns

Example of a safe implementation: validate inputs before passing them to the AI model.
