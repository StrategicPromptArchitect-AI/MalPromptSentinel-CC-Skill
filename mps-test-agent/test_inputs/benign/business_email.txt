Hi team,

I wanted to follow up on our discussion from yesterday's meeting. Please ignore my previous email about the budget allocation - I've updated the figures based on the latest projections.

The new proposal includes:
- Marketing: $50K
- Development: $120K
- Operations: $80K

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
John
